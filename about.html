		<p>This is the second annual Johns Hopkins Arts for Hearts performing benefit showcase for the American Heart Association. The American Heart Association is America’s oldest and largest voluntary organization dedicated to fighting heart disease and stroke. Heart disease is the number one cause of death of Americans, followed closely by stroke at number five. Arts for Hearts donations to the American Heart Association will fund innovative research, the fight for stronger public health policies, and critical tools and information to save and improve lives. We all have one heart and only one life.</p>

It will highlight JHU's strong relationship with the Baltimore community in addition to the relationship with all of its campuses. Everyone is welcome!</p>
		<p>Arts for Hearts stands for the coalescence of the Arts and Sciences, JHU's campuses and the Baltimore community, and the collaboration of the most vast, dynamic, and multitudinous JHU student groups. Arts for Hearts is an event to raise money for a great cause, to enjoy the community around us, and to spread awareness and hope through heartfelt performances.</p>

		<h1>About the JHU School of Nursing Arts for Hearts Coordinator, Dr. Nancy Goldstein</h1>
		<img class="NancyHeadshot" src="{{ site.url }}/images/NancyHeadshot.jpg"/>
		<p>Nancy Goldstein, DNP, ANP-BC has been a practicing nurse for over 35 years in the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutes and University, caring for patients, participating in research, and educating future nurses. She is a nurse practitioner and faculty of the Department of Acute and Chronic Care at Johns Hopkins University School of Nursing (JHUSON). She is a member of numerous professional organizations including the American Nurses Association/Maryland Nurses Association (ANA/MNA), Association of Women’s Health, Obstetric, and Neonatal Nursing (AWHONN), and the Oncology Nursing Society.</p>
 
		<p>Life experiences have directed Dr. Goldstein to focus volunteer efforts to the American Heart Association. She is on the Johns Hopkins Heart Walk Steering Committee and Captain of the Johns Hopkins University School of Nursing Heart Walk Team. Several years ago a family member was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy, who then underwent multiple surgeries, had complications including a stroke, and eventually ended with a heart transplant. Without the research and advances sponsored by the AHA, much of the opportunities provided to this family member would not have been possible. Thus, fundraising has become a part of life for Dr. Goldstein and her family. She is greatly devoted to working with the Homewood Campus team to produce a successful benefit for the AHA.</p>
