		<h1>About the JHU School of Nursing Arts for Hearts Coordinator, Dr. Nancy Goldstein</h1>
			<img class="Headshot" src="{{ site.url }}/images/NancyHeadshot.jpg"/>
			<p>Nancy Goldstein, DNP, ANP-BC has been a practicing nurse for over 35 years in the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutes and University, caring for patients, participating in research, and educating future nurses.

She is a member of numerous professional organizations including the American Nurses Association/Maryland Nurses Association (ANA/MNA), Association of Women’s Health, Obstetric, and Neonatal Nursing (AWHONN), and the Oncology Nursing Society.</p>
			<p>Life experiences have directed Dr. Goldstein to focus volunteer efforts to the American Heart Association.

Several years ago a family member was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy, who then underwent multiple surgeries, had complications including a stroke, and eventually ended with a heart transplant. Without the research and advances sponsored by the AHA, much of the opportunities provided to this family member would not have been possible. Thus, fundraising has become a part of life for Dr. Goldstein and her family. She is greatly devoted to working with the Homewood Campus team to produce a successful benefit for the AHA.</p>
